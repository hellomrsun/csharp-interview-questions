1. #### What is CSharp?

C# (pronounced "See Sharp") is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), type-safe, and component-oriented programming disciplines. 

It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft as part of its .NET initiative, and later approved as an international standard by Ecma (ECMA-334) and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270:2018). 

Mono is the name of the free and open-source project to develop a compiler and runtime for the language. 

C# is one of the programming languages designed for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).

C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg, and its development team is currently led by Mads Torgersen.

2. #### What is the root type of all types?

C# has a unified type system. 

All C# types, including primitive types such as int and double, inherit from a single root **object** type. 

Thus, all types share a set of common operations, and values of any type can be stored, transported, and operated upon in a consistent manner. 

Furthermore, C# supports both user-defined reference types and value types, allowing dynamic allocation of objects as well as in-line storage of lightweight structures.

3. #### What is an object?

Object is the base type for all the other types.

Object's body:

```csharp
[ClassInterface(ClassInterfaceType.AutoDual)]
[ComVisible(true)]
public class Object
{
    [NonVersionableAttribute]
    [ReliabilityContract(Consistency.WillNotCorruptState, Cer.MayFail)]
    public Object();

    [NonVersionableAttribute]
    [ReliabilityContract(Consistency.WillNotCorruptState, Cer.Success)]
    ~Object();

    public static bool Equals(Object objA, Object objB);
    
    [NonVersionableAttribute]
    [ReliabilityContract(Consistency.WillNotCorruptState, Cer.Success)]
    public static bool ReferenceEquals(Object objA, Object objB);
    
    public virtual bool Equals(Object obj);

    public virtual int GetHashCode();

    [SecuritySafeCritical]
    public Type GetType();

    public virtual string ToString();

    [SecuritySafeCritical]
    protected Object MemberwiseClone();
}
```

Object has 2 extension methods: **Equals** and **ReferenceEquals**.
Equals: compares two objects' values
ReferenceEquals: compares two objects' references

Object has 3 default virtual methods **Equals**, **GetHashCode**, **ToString**.
You can override the default methods in your customized derived types (structs, classes).

Object has 1 public method **GetType** to get the type of a variable.

4. #### What is a value type?

Value type includes **all numeric** types, **DateTime**, **Timespan**, **Struct** and **Enum** types.

<br/>

The characteristics of a value type is: a value type variable contains a simple value.
When you copy an value type variable, you create **a new copy of the value**.

<br/>

```csharp
//Declare a struct
public struct Rectangle{
    public int X {get;set;}
    public int Y {get;set;}
}

public static void Main(){
    var rectangle1 = new Rectangle(){
        X = 5,
        Y = 10
    };
    var rectangle2 = rectangle1;
    rectangle1.X = 6;
    Console.WriteLine(rectangle1.X); //Display: 6
    Console.WriteLine(rectangle2.X); //Display: 5, rectangle2'X has changed
}
```

<br/>

To check if a variable is value type, you can simply do this:
```csharp
var value = 10;
var isValueType = value.GetType().IsValueType;
Console.WriteLine(isValueType); //Display: true
```

<br/>

5. #### What is a reference type?

Reference type includes **class**, **string**, **delegates**, **interface**, and **array** types.

<br/>

| C# Reference type keyword | .NET type     | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| object                    | System.Object | Base type of all types                                                |
| string                    | System.String | An array of characters                                                |
| dynamic                   | System.Object | To the common language runtime (CLR), dynamic is identical to object. |

<br/>

When you copy an reference type variable, you **create a new copy of reference** pointing to the same value.

```csharp
//Declare a class
public class Circle{
    public int Radius {get;set;}
}

public static void Main(){
    var circle1 = new Circle(){
        Radius = 1
    };
    var circle2 = circle1;
    circle1.Radius = 2;
    Console.WriteLine(circle1.Radius); //Display: 2
    Console.WriteLine(circle2.Radius); //Display: 2, circle2 has the same reference as circle1
}
```

6. #### What is the difference between value type and reference type?

Value typed data is stored in stack.

Reference typed data is stored in heap, the reference to data is stored in stack.

<br/>

7. #### What is a class?

A type that is defined as a class is a reference type.
Its default value is null.

```csharp
public class Student{
    public string Name {get;set;}
}
public static void Main(){
    Student student;
    Console.WriteLine(student.Name == null); //Display: true
}
```

<br/>

**[![](images/chevron.png) back to top](#CSharp-interview-questions-and-answers)**

<br/>

8. #### What is a struct?

A structure type (or struct type) is a value type that can encapsulate data and related functionality.

Typically, you use structure types to design **small data-centric types** that provide little or no behavior. 
For example, .NET uses structure types to represent a number (both integer and real), a Boolean value, a Unicode character, a time instance.

```csharp
public struct Coordinate {
    public decimal X {get;set;}
    public decimal Y {get;set;}
}
```

<br/>

<br/>

9. #### What are access modifiers?

**public**: can be accessed in same assembly or different assembly

**internal**: can be accessed in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.

**protected internal**: can be accessed in the same assembly, or derived types in another assembly.

**protected**: can be accessed in the same class or derived class.

**private protected**: can be accessed in the same class or derived class.

**private**: The type or member can be accessed only by code in the same class or struct.

<br/>

Classes and structs declared **directly within a namespace** (in other words, that aren't nested within other classes or structs) can be either **public** or **internal**. Internal is the default if no access modifier is specified.


```csharp
namespace CSharpAssembly {
    //The following are OK
    public class ClassA {}
    internal class ClassB {} 

    //The following are KO
    //Compile-time error: Elements defined in a namespace cannot be explicitly declared as private, protected, or protected internal
    private class ClassC {} 
    protected class ClassD {}
    private protected class ClassE {} 
    protected internal class ClassF {} 
}
```

<br/>

Class members could be **public**, **internal**, **protected**, **protected internal**, **private**, **private protected**, and **private**.

##### Class member access modifier table:

<br/>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Access Modifier</b></td><td><b>C# version</b></td><td colspan=3><b>Same Assembly</b></td><td colspan=2><b>Different Assembly</b></td></tr>
<tr><td></td><td></td><td><b>Same class</b></td><td><b>Derived class</b></td><td><b>Other class</b></td><td><b>Derived class</b></td><td><b>Other class</b></td></tr>
<tbody>
<tr><td><b>Public</b><td></td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Internal</b></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Protected Internal</b></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Protected</b></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td>Y</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Private Protected</b></td><td>7.2 or later</td><td>Y</td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Private</b></td><td></td><td>Y</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>

10. #### What is a sealed class?

Sealed class can not be inherited.

```csharp
public sealed class A{
    public int Add(int x, int y){
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

<br/>

**[![](images/chevron.png) back to top](#CSharp-interview-questions-and-answers)**

<br/>

11. #### What is a partial class?

Partial class means a class can be divided into several classes.

Partial class could be generated automatically by frameworks like ASP.NET Web Forms, or Entity Framework etc.

ASP.NET Web Forms example:

```csharp
//File: About.aspx.cs
public partial class About : Page
{
    protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
    }
}
//File: About.aspx.designer.cs
public partial class About
{
}
```

In the above About class you can see, if one partial class already inherit from a base class, its homologue will not need to inherit the same base class again in the declaration.

Entity framework generated partial dbContext:

```csharp
public partial class WineDbEntities : DbContext
{
    public WineDbEntities()
        : base("name=WineDbEntities")
    {
    }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(DbModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        throw new UnintentionalCodeFirstException();
    }

    public virtual DbSet<C__EFMigrationsHistory> C__EFMigrationsHistory { get; set; }
    public virtual DbSet<Grape> Grape { get; set; }
}
```

Entity framework generated partial data model:

```csharp
public partial class Grape
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
}
```

Partial class could also be used in different components of the same framework.

Take a example of CoreCLR:

```csharp
//File path: TypeSystem\RuntimeDetermined\TypeDesc.RuntimeDetermined.cs
namespace Internal.TypeSystem
{
    partial class TypeDesc
    {
        public abstract bool IsRuntimeDeterminedSubtype
        {
            get;
        }

        public bool IsRuntimeDeterminedType
        {
            get
            {
                return this.GetType() == typeof(RuntimeDeterminedType);
            }
        }

        public abstract TypeDesc GetNonRuntimeDeterminedTypeFromRuntimeDeterminedSubtypeViaSubstitution(Instantiation typeInstantiation, Instantiation methodInstantiation);
    }
}

//File path: TypeSystem\Serialization\TypeDesc.Serialization.cs
namespace Internal.TypeSystem
{
    partial class TypeDesc
    {
        public virtual bool IsSerializable
        {
            get
            {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

**Important:** partial class must be in the same namespace and same physical assembly (.dll or .exe).

12. #### What is an abstract class?

Abstract class is always used with abstract method, and act as the base class.

Abstract class can not be instantiated, you have to instantiate its derived class.

```csharp
public abstract class Employee
{
    public abstract void Do();
}
public class Worker : Employee
{
    public override void Do()
    {
        //DO
    }
}
```

31.    #### What is the difference between string and System.String? 

The string type represents a sequence of zero or more Unicode characters. string is an alias for System.String in .NET.

string is an alias in C#
System.String is a .NET type.

74.    #### Write a singleton class

This is a singleton logger implemented with Lazy.

```csharp
public class Logger
{
    private static readonly ILog Log = LogManager.GetLogger(typeof(LoggerConfigurator));

    private static readonly Lazy<LogWrapper> Lazy = new Lazy<LogWrapper>(() => new LogWrapper(Log));

    public static LogWrapper Instance
    {
        get { return Lazy.Value; }
    }
}
```

75.     #### What are design patterns?

Design patterns are common best practices in developing software.

The book **Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software** introduced 23 design patterns.

This book has 4 authors: Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, John Vlissides, so the design patterns are also called **Gang of Four Design Patterns**.

They are 3 types of design patterns:

- **Creational** design patterns:
  - **Abstract factory** groups object factories that have a common theme.
  - **Builder** constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
  - **Factory method** creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
  - **Prototype** creates objects by cloning an existing object.
  - **Singleton** restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

<br/>

- **Structual** design patterns:
  - **Adapter** allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an existing class.
  - **Bridge** decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
  - **Composite** composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
  - **Decorator** dynamically adds/overrides behaviour in an existing method of an object.
  - **Facade** provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
  - **Flyweight** reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
  - **Proxy** provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.
  
  <br/>

- **Behaviorial** design patterns:
  - **Chain of responsibility** delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
  - **Command** creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
  - **Interpreter** implements a specialized language.
  - **Iterator** accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
  - **Mediator** allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
  - **Memento** provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
  - **Observer** is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
  - **State** allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
  - **Strategy** allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
  - **Template** method defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
  - **Visitor** separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.
